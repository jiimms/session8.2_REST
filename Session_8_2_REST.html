	REST with HTTP
	Problem Statement: Explain REST with HTTP  
	REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is the foundation of the RESTful architecture. Actions in REST map to URIs that identify resources. REST operates on resource representations that can differ from the data representations stored in the application database. REST in terms of Rails boils down to two main principles:

Using resource identifiers such as URLs to represent resources.
Transferring representations of the state of that resource between system components.
Rails maps the HTTP methods to controller methods as:
		GET    => show
		PUT    => update
		POST   => create
		DELETE => destroy
	The Rails router is responsible for redirecting incoming requests to controller actions.
