	<p style= "text-decoration: underline;">Problem Statement: Explain REST with HTTP  </p>
	<p>REST stands for <b><span style= "color: red;">Representational State Transfer</span></b> and is the foundation of the RESTful architecture. <br>Actions in REST map to URIs that identify resources. REST operates on resource representations that can differ from the data representations stored in the application database. <br> REST in terms of Rails boils down to two main principles:
<ol><li>
Using resource identifiers such as URLs to represent resources.</li><li>
Transferring representations of the state of that resource between system components.</li></ol>
<p>Rails maps the HTTP methods to controller methods as:
	<ul style="list-style: none;">
		<li>GET    => show</li>
		<li>PUT    => update</li>
		<li>POST   => create</li>
		<li>DELETE => destroy</li>
	</ul>
	The Rails router is responsible for redirecting incoming requests to controller actions.
